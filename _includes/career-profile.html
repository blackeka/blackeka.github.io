<div class="summary">
    <p>I am a full stack developer specializing in JavaScript. I am currently solidifying my project management skills and knowledge and working towards my CAPM certification. In my most recent position I spent a majority of my time in a Project Management roll while continuing to participate in the develoment with the rest of my team. I thrive on the organization and planning required to successfully complete projects on budget and within a deadline.</p>
    
    <p>I have experience working with a range of technologies across the stack to create single-page web apps. I have expertise in ES6, React, React Native, Redux, building servers with Node and Express, SQL and NoSQL databases. While I love the challenge of creating something from nothing, I enthusiastically embrace learning new technologies as well as the challenge of diving into legacy code.</p>
        
    <p>I have a love for all things science, at Oregon Sate University I received a B.S. in Marine Biology and contributed to research efforts along the West Coast. In hopes of bringing innovative technology to the research community, I've developed and honed my software engineering skills through immersive coding training. My time working at a startup confirmed my develoment skills and established my project management experience. I am currently seeking a position in Project Management, open to relocating.
